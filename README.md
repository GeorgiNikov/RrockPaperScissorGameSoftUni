1.A classic two-person game.But now for one when you are alone and don't know what to do.The player start each round by typing: "r" for "rock", "p" for "paper" and "s" for "scissors". The computer also choose betweeen these three things.

2.Rules:Rock wins against scissors, paper wins against rock and scissors wins against paper. If both player and computer throw the same sign, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner.
